Special add-on or plug-in software required to apply to an HTTP client to prevent indiscriminant copying by users.
However, it should not perform these operations when it is loading medicines to the medicine dispenser. 
All data is assigned security level that reflects its relative sensitivity, confidentiality, and protection value. 
Loading medicines to medicine dispenser, creating medicine order and picking medicines from the medicine dispenser are operations forming a critical task.
In our case study this means that the residents themselves must also be regarded as principals for whom we define access rights. 
The principals involved in an information system are usually thought of as staff members of a certain organisation. 
So, for example, the manager should be made aware of repeated attempts by a health care worker to access information beyond their rights.  
Clearly, the manager does not wish to be informed about every access but some logging is still necessary. 
In an electronic system this overview must be supplied by some form of logging of accesses and access attempts. 
For a special purpose, access to an older medical record can be sought and obtained from the manager. 
This period is seven years for someone who is not of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent and nine years for someone who is. 
The care plan is updated in consultation with the resident or the responsible person.  
In the current paper-based system, this is prevented by requiring that any new entry be signed by the doctor making that entry. 
This does not mean, however, that she has unrestricted access. 
This is one type of Dynamic Separation of Duty (DSOD) policy. 
For example, according to Figure 2, supervisor role inherits purchasing officer¡¯s permissions and purchasing officer inherits clerk¡¯s permissions. 
In addition, the role hierarchy implicitly authorizes a specialized role to inherit permissions.
Access is authorized or restricted to objects based on the security characteristics of the HTTP client.
Access is authorized or restricted to objects based on the time of day depending on the labeling on the resource and the user's credentials. 
Access to information is determined based on authorizations to access control lists based on user identifier and group membership. 
It is used to enforce authorisation rules on bonus allocation among the employees of a company.
There do not exist members of STUDENT who can ASSIGN EXTERNALGRADES. 
There exists no combination of roles such that a user with those roles can both RECEIVE and ASSIGN the resource EXTERNALGRADES.
The need to make this arrangement is only to allow the manager and resident to set a time that is convenient to both of them. 
This is permitted with the consent of the resident or the responsible person and the notification of the manager.
Occasionally, due to pressing circumstances, it may be necessary for a visiting doctor to examine a resident who is not normally his/her patient.
Their main form of access is to view the care plan for each resident and to add progress note entries based on their observations.
